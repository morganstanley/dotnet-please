# dotnet-please

This CLI tool aims to streamline some repetitive tasks around Visual Studio 
projects and solutions, including renaming multiple projects, extracting
NuGet package versions into properties, and many more.

Note: Although some commands might work with the legacy project file format,
the tool is meant for SDK-style project files.

## Installation

To install `please` as a global dotnet tool, clone the repo and run the `build-and-install.ps1` script.
If you install dotnet tools to a custom folder, either pass 
the folder to the script, or create an environment variable called `DotNetToolsPath`.

Then to get the list of available commands:

```
please --help
```


## Usage

Open a command prompt, navigate to your solution's root directory, and start
asking things. Commands are normally kebab-cased, but the dashes can be 
replaced with spaces to make them more readable.

Most commands have a `--stage` option to just list what the command would do,
but we strongly advise to back up/commit your code before pleasing your projects.

To get a complete list of options and arguments for each command, run
```
please --help
```
or
```
please <command> --help
```


### Consolidate NuGet packages

#### Basic usage

Consolidate all NuGet package references in the solution to the highest version used:

```
please consolidate packages
```

Limit the command to specific packages:

```
please consolidate packages --package Microsoft.Extensions.*
```

Set a specific version number (must be used with `--package`):

```
please consolidate packages --package Microsoft.Extensions.* --version 3.1.3
```

#### Keeping package versions in a central .props file

When working with large solutions with lots of projects, some teams choose to keep
their dependencies in a separate file (let's say Dependencies.props), typically
imported in a Directory.Build.props file:

Dependencies.props:
```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <xunitVersion>2.4.1</xunitVersion>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Directory.Build.props:

```xml
<Project>
    <Import Project="Dependencies.props" />
</Project>
```

In the project file:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="$(xunitVersion)" />
<ItemGroup>
```

Use `please` to update all package references and the .props file:

```
please consolidate packages --props Dependencies.props
```

`please` will add the missing properties to your .props file and replace package 
versions with property names in the project files. You can still update packages
using NuGet CLI or Visual Studio. When you're done, just run the command again
and your references will be consistent.

In case you want to back out from using a .props file, use the `--explicit` option
to replace the property names with actual versions:

```
please consolidate packages --explicit
```

### Manage package versions centrally

A set of commands are continually added to support centrally managed NuGet package versions
(see https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Centrally-managing-NuGet-package-versions).

#### Move explicit versions to a central file

Use the `pull-package-versions` command to pull explicit package versions from projects into
a central packages file.

```
please pull package versions Dependencies.props
```

This command will 
1. scan all the projects in the solution, extract and remove any explicit `Version` attributes from
`PackageReference` items
2. update the specified `.props` file, add the missing `PackageVersion` items with the extracted versions.

When the file name is omitted, `dotnet-please` will try to find a `Directory.Packages.props` file
in the directory tree (to conform with the original NuGet proposal).

It is also possible to update the existing `PackageVersion` items if some projects reference newer versions:

```
please pull package versions --update
```

### Move/rename projects

To rename or move a project while fixing the solution file and any project references:

```
please move project Old/Path/OldProjectName.csproj New/Path/NewProjectName.csproj
```

To just rename a project (by renaming the .csproj file and its directory):

```
please move project OldProjectName NewProjectName
```

You can also rename projects in bulk (eg. when trying to change the root namespace of
your 100-project solution):

```
please change namespace Old.Namespace New.Namespace
```

### Fix broken project references

Having a hard time fixing a broken solution after moving projects manually?

```
please fix project references
```

The tool will try to fix any broken reference by looking for a project
with the same file name (but at a different relative path), and remove the reference 
if that fails.

### Clean up leftover files and projects

To remove any code files that were explicitly excluded with a `<Complile Remove="..."/>` item:

```
please cleanup project files
```

This will remove the file AND the `Compile` item.

Use the `--allow-globs` option to remove files that were excluded with a globbing pattern.

To list projects that are not included in the solution, run:

```
please find stray projects
```

### Remove junk from the solution directory

Delete those magic folders after a table-flipping Visual Studio experience:

```
please remove junk --bin --suo --testStore
```

(or just use those options individually)

### Change the `PATH` variable

To quickly append the working directory to the user's `PATH` variable, run

```
please add to path
```

Conversely, you can remove the working directory from `PATH`:

```
please remove from path
```

You can also specify the directory to add or remove, relative to the working directory:

```
please add to path some/relative/path
```

### Evaluate MSBuild properties

This can be useful when troubleshooting build errors. To load, evaluate and list all the properties  
in a project file with their unevaluated and evaluated values:

```
please evaluate props MyProject.csproj
```
